EES1132/EESD21 Final Project 
Deadlines: October 29 and   November 26 and   December   10, 2024 
Introduction The   primary goal of this project   is to allow you to independently   apply   your   new   data   analysis   skills   to   a   climate change or geophysics   problem of your choice. You are expected to   use   several   of the   methods   learned   in class to ask and answer a research   question   using   climate   or   other   geophysical   data   and   to      tell a coherent and   interesting   story.
Project Components (Total Marks: 100) 
1.       Project Proposal + Goal-Setting (Oct. 29, 2024) 
10 marks 
2.       Class Presentation with peer-feedback (Nov. 26, 2024) 10 marks 
3.       Project Report (Dec. 10, 2024) 80 marks 
1. Project Proposal + Goal-Setting 
The first   phase of the   project   is to choose a topic, find the data   and write   up   a   project   proposal. Your proposal along with a your project goals and timeline   (~4-5   pages,   double-spaced)   are   due October 26, 2024. Please discuss your topic with Prof. Mirza before the deadline. One of the   key evaluation criteria of the project proposal is feasibility. This   means   that   you   must   find   the   data   you   require   to   complete your project as part of your   proposal. Don’t delay trying to find your data! 
A rubric for the   proposal   is   included   in a separate document. Submit your proposal   via   Quercus   by   23:59   ET on October 29st,   2024.
2. In Class Presentations During   the final   class, November 26, 2024, we will   hold   an   in-person   presentation   session.   During   the   presentation   session   (5   Minutes),   we   will   all   get   a   chance   to   view   and   give   feedback   on   each   other’s   work.Specifically, you will create a presentation that describes your research questi代 写EES1132/EESD21 Final Project 2024Python

You   will    be required to complete a peer evaluation form   for   each   presentation you view as part of your class   participation grade.
A rubric for the   presentation   is   included   in a separate   document.   Submit your   recorded   presentation   via   Quercus   by   11:59   ET on   November 26th, 2024.
3. Project Report Write   up   your   analysis   in   the   style   of   a   scientific   journal   article   (Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusions), maximum of 20-pages (double-spaced), 5 figures and 2 tables.   Note   that   one   figure can have multiple panels.   A   journal   article   of this   length   is what   is   known   as   a   letter.   Look   at the journal Geophysical Research Letters, for some examples. The deadline for the final report is December 10, 2024. 
A rubric for the report   is included   in a separate   document.   Submit your   report   via   Quercus   by   23:59   ET   on   December   10th, 2024.
Final NoteA   successful project does not necessarily mean that you   find a novel, robust statistical result that supports   your hypothesis - your analysis might not support your hypothesis at all and that’sok.   A   successful project   is one   that clearly states a plausible research question and hypothesis, addresses       the   question/hypothesis   using   the   most   relevant   data   and   most   appropriate   statistical   methods   (within   the   scope   of   this   course)   and   thoughtfully   interprets   the   results,   e.g.   discussing   underlying   assumptions,   confounding variables, data quality/quantity, etc.
